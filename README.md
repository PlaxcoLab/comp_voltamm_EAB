This repository includes some of the data analysis scripts for the manuscript "Comparison of voltammetric methods used in the interrogation of  electrochemical aptamer-based sensors" by Elsi Verrinder, Kaylyn K. Leung, Lior Sepunaru, and Kevin W. Plaxco.

The script expects the data as an xlsx file in the same folder.
